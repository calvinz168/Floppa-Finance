            var content = ["Interest Rates (credit cards)<ul type='disc'><li>How Interest is Charged<ul type='disc'><li>The credit card rate is expressed as an APR or annual percentage rate. You'll find a list of all the APRs for a credit card in the credit card disclosure. The interest rate currently being applied to your balances is on your billing statement along with each balance.</li><li>Most credit cards have a grace period during which you can pay your balance in full and avoid paying interest. Any balance left beyond the grace period will be charged interest in the form of a finance charge.</li><li>Finance charges are calculated in a variety of ways, depending on your credit card terms. Some credit card issuers calculate finance charges based on your average daily credit card balance, the balance at the beginning of the billing cycle, or the balance at the end of your billing cycle. Finance charges may or may not include new purchases made on your credit card.</li></ul></li>","Fixed vs Variable Interest<ul type='disc'><li>There are two basic types of credit card interest rates—fixed and variable. Fixed interest rates can only change in certain circumstances, and the credit card issuer must send advance notice before changing your rate.</li><li>Variable interest rates, on the other hand, are tied to another interest rate (the prime rate, for example) and can change whenever the index rate changes. Your credit card issuer doesn't have to give advance notice if your variable rate changes, so long as the change is the result of an increase in the index rate. The majority of credit card interest rates are variable.</li></ul>","Annual Percentage Rates (APRs)<ul type='disc'><li>Your credit card may have different APRs for different types of balances. For example, your card may have a purchase APR, cash advance APR, and balance transfer APR. Each of these interest rates may be different. Your card may also have a penalty APR that goes into effect when you default on your credit card terms, for example by making a late payment.</li><li>When you make a payment to a credit card that has different balances with different APRs, any amount above the minimum payment must go to the balance with the highest APR.</li></ul>","Periodic Interest Rates<ul type='disc'><li>Credit cards also have a periodic rate, which is really just another way of stating the regular APR for a period of time less than a year. The periodic rate for monthly interest, for example, is simply the APR divided by the number of months in the year. Periodic rates are more often based on a billing cycle shorter than one month. In that case, the periodic rate is calculated as (APR/days in a year) times days in a billing cycle. The daily rate is another periodic rate calculated by dividing the APR by the number of days in the year (365 or 366 in a leap year).</li></ul>","Minimum Payment<ul type='disc'><li>When a customer is unable to repay the entire debt to the bank, they need to make a minimum payment on the card after the interest-free period.</li><li>In some banks, the payment amount is calculated from the spent amount of the credit limit or about 5%-10% of the total amount. Other banks define a specific contribution in cash.</li><li>Crediting the minimum payment allows the customer to continue using credit money and keep their good borrower status for the bank.</li></ul>"]

            var content = ["Billing Cycle<ul type='disc'><li>A billing cycle is the interval of time from the end of one billing statement date to the next billing statement date for goods or services a company provides to another company or consumer on a recurring basis. Although billing cycles are most often set on a monthly basis, they can vary in length depending on the type of product or service rendered.</li>","How to find your billing cycle<ul type='disc'><li>Keeping up with your payment cycle can be difficult, as the dates do not coincide with the beginning and end of the calendar month. The customer can check their latest credit card statement or online account to find their billing cycle. If they need to calculate the number of days in the payment cycle, count the number of days between the beginning and the last payment cycle.</li><li>For example, if the last payment cycle was from January 5, 2020 to February 1, 2020, the payment cycle will be 27 days. Using the information, the credit card user can calculate the end of the next payment cycle. Countdown 27 days from February 1 to February 28, 2020.</li></ul>","Billing Period with a Fixed Date<ul type='disc'><li>In an attempt to simplify their work and life for the client, some credit institutions set a fixed date for the end of the payment period. In doing so, they do not consider the date of registration of the credit agreement, as well as the beginning of the client’s usage of the card.</li><li>Banks often take the first day of any month as the reference date. Therefore, the payment period ends at the end of the month, approximately 22-25 days.</li></ul>","Calculation Period<ul type='disc'><li>The period during which all credit card costs are taken into account is called the calculation period. It includes both non-cash transactions and cash withdrawals. It lasts from the moment the card statement is generated until the payment date. When the calculation period comes to an end, the billing cycle begins.</li></ul>","Payment Due Dates<ul type='disc'><li>Your credit card payment due date is generally about 21 to 25 days after your billing cycle ends.1﻿ The time between your billing cycle end date and your billing due date is known as the grace period. You typically can pay your balance in full before the end of the grace period to avoid paying interest on your balance. You may not receive a grace period if you didn't pay your balance in full after your last billing cycle or if you've transferred a balance or taken out a cash advance.</li><li>Certain types of credit card transactions, such as cash advances and balance transfers, may not allow for a grace period. Thus, these transactions begin accruing interest as soon as the money is posted to your account, assuming that you don't have a 0% promotional rate in effect.</li><li>New purchases on a credit card may lack a grace period if you start the billing cycle with a balance. If you want to avoid paying interest on a transaction that doesn't have a grace period, you'll have to pay it off immediately.</li></ul>"]

            var content = ["<h2>Cash</h2><ul type='disc'><li>Pay In Person - Contact the companies to which you routinely pay bills, such as utilities and phone companies. Ask if they have a local office that accepts cash payments. Be sure to ask for a receipt when you pay so you have proof that someone received your payment. While many companies accept cash payments in person, not all do so for free. For example, if you visit certain wireless phone retailers to pay a bill, you might have to fork over an additional processing fee.</li>","<h2>Cash</h2><ul type='disc'><li>Mail A Money Order - You can get money orders at post offices, convenience stores, major grocery stores and certain banks for a small fee, usually $1 or $2. Specify the exact amount of the bill when purchasing the money order. Fill out the payee information and sign it right away. Be sure to write your full name, address and account number on the money order, and include a payment stub in the envelope so that your payment gets properly applied to your account. Also, keep your portion of the money order so you can get a new one if it gets lost in the mail. Avoid mailing cash to pay a bill. It might end up in someone else’s pocket other than the company you’re trying to pay.</li>","<h2>Cheque</h2><ul type='disc'><li>A cheque is a written 'order to pay', which you sign and give to another party as payment. When you pay using a cheque, you are instructing your financial institution to give money from your account to the person (or organization) that is depositing the cheque.</li>","<h2>Tips to fill in a cheque</h2><ol type='disc'><li>If you're using a computer to do this, use a minimum 10 point font and dark ink colours that will show up well in images.</li><li>You should ensure that you have sufficient funds in your account to cover the cheques that you write. It's a good idea to keep a record of the cheques you write so you know which ones have been deposited and which ones are still outstanding.</li><li>Use a pen with black or blue ink whenever you write a check. If you use a pencil, anybody with an eraser can change the amount of your check and the name of the payee.</li><li>When you’re filling in the dollar amount, make sure you print the value in a way that prevents scammers from adding to it. Do this by starting at the far left edge of the space, and draw a line after the last digit.</li><li>If you want a paper record of every check you write, get checkbooks with carbon copies. Those checkbooks feature a thin sheet containing a copy of every check you write.</li>","<h2>Filling in a Cheque</h2><ol type='disc'><li>Current date: Write this near the top right-hand corner. In most cases, you’ll use today’s date, which helps you and the recipient keep accurate records.</li><li>Payee: On the line that says 'Pay to the order of,' write the name of the person or organization you’re paying.</li><li>Amount in numeric form: Write the amount of your payment in the small box on the right-hand side. Start writing as far over to the left as possible.</li><li>Amount in words: Write out the amount using words to avoid fraud and confusion. This will be the official amount of your payment.</li><li>Signature: Sign the check legibly on the line in the bottom-right corner. Use the same name and signature on file at your bank. A check will not be valid without a signature.</li><li>Memo (or 'For') line: If you like, include a note. This step is optional and will not affect how banks process your check.</li><li>After you write the check, make a record of the payment. Recording the payment prevents you from spending the money twice—the funds will still show as available in your account until after the check is deposited or cashed.</li>","<h2>Stale-dated cheques</h2><ul type='disc'><li>Cheques are considered stale-dated after six months, unless certified. A stale-dated cheque simply means that the item is old, and not necessarily invalid. Financial institutions may still honour these items, but there is no obligation to do</li>"]

You’ll save time sorting through bills and figuring out what you should keep, what can be thrown in the trash, and what must be shredded.</li><li>If you download your billing statements, you can save them to your computer or external drive and access later when you need them. Most credit card issuers make several months of billing statements available online, so it may not be necessary to save your most recent statements.</li></ul></li>","Con: Easier to Miss Payments<ul type='disc'><li>Without receiving a mailed statement, you could forget to send your payment. As an alternative to a mailed physical statement as a due date reminder, you could print the statement from your online account and keep it where you normally put your bills.</li></ul>","Pro: Perks for Online Billing Statements<ul type='disc'><li>Some credit card issuers offer incentives to cardholders who sign up for paperless statements. For example, you may be entered into sweepstakes when you switch to paperless billing statements. Some card issuers charge a fee to send a paper statement and waive this fee when you sign up to receive your billing statement online.</li></ul>","Con: Less Access to Previous Statements<ul type='disc'><li>Credit card issuers typically only make a certain number of statements available online. If you need more than that, e.g., for tax purposes, you may have to go through a few extra steps (and could even have to pay a fee) to access older statements. You could get around this by printing your billing statement each month and filing it away so you can access it if you need to.</li></ul>","Pro: Identity Theft Protection<ul type='disc'><li>Switching to paperless statements could help prevent identity theft resulting from stolen mail. Since statements aren’t mailed to your home, mail thieves won’t get access to your credit card number if they intercept your mail. Thankfully, emails from your credit card issuer should never contain your full account number which gives you extra protection if your email account is compromised.</li></ul>","Con: Delay in Catching Credit Card Fraud and Credit Card Changes<ul type='disc'><li>If you’ve set up an automatic payment for your account, you could easily forget to review your statements each month, a step that’s critical to catching credit card fraud. You have 60 days to report billing errors, beyond that the credit card issuer could make you pay for purchases you never made.</li><li>There’s another downside to paying without reading your statement – you won't receive an alert to changes in your minimum payment. If your minimum payment increases beyond the payment you’ve set, you’ll be hit with a late fee even if the payment is made on time. After 60 days, your interest rate will increase, and the late payment status will hit your credit report.</li></ul>"]
