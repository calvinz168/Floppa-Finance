﻿# Floppa-Finance

# Overview
Floppa Finance is a project developed by Team Big Floppas - Calvin Zheng, Vivian Ren, Caleb Wong, Caitlin Lee, and Gaveen Weerasinghe, for the Tech Under 20 Cup Business competition. Designed to help educate youth about finance, we designed a web-based system where users are able to learn about finance through 'modules' presented in interactive slideshows, as well as interact with others through discussion posts and comments on the community page.

# Development
The Floppa Finance web application uses a Python backend and HTML/CSS frontend, and utilizes the Flask Python package to integrate them together. By sending and receiving data through Flask, we are able to create a dynamic system where users can submit posts or comments to discussion pages, have unique login sessions that can store persisting data to their specific account, and keep a presentable, functional layout. 

# Next Steps
We are very happy to have been awarded the RBC company challenge award for helping make financial services more accessible, and hope to continue working on and developing this project, possibly publishing it. Some features we would like to develop and implement in the future are: 
* To expand the number of modules and quizzes developed 
* Integrate a more stable database for storing and moderating data
* Redesign the layout to have a greater user experience

This has been a fantastic learning experience for everyone involved and we all look forward to seeing where this project could lead to in the future!
